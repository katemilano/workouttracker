# Workout Tracker

## Description
This application allows you to input a workouts.  With the proper input, you are able to track the weight, and duration of the exercise for weight excerises over the past 7 workouts. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, you are only able to track my duration.  These results can be displayed on the dashboard with charts able showing which workouts contributed the most/least.  This also allows you to remove workouts to see only certain ones.
